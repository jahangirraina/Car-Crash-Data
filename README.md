# Modelling / Machine Learning Car Crash Data
Data is provided on crash frequencies among various randomly selected cohorts, along with the risk variables in those cohorts. Our task is to identify correlations and model the data.

# Data Intro
The following columns have crash frequencies:
- 'Frontal Impact (per 100,000 vehicles)',
- 'Rear Impact (per 100,000 vehicles)',
- 'Front Offset Impact (per 100,000 vehicles)',
- 'Side Impact (per 100,000 vehicles)'

The following columns have data on risk variables:
- 'Average EuroNCAP Lane Deviation Score',
- 'Driver Claim History Rating',
- 'No Year no claims',
